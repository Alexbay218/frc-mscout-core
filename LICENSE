		Public User Data Special License v1.0
					Introduction
This License overrides AGPL in some places described here.
The reason is to create a mechanism in which derivative works
are forced to also supply the same EULA that end users must
agree to. The goal of the EULA is to have end users publish
data generated by this software. This is part of a vision to
create an open source system.

						Terms
Derivative works refer to works that modify or reuse code
without the expressed permission of the author. Derivative 
works also refer to binaries created using the source code.
EULA refers to the End User License Agreement included with 
the repository with the file name of EULA.

					  Section 1
The following mechanisms or sections mentioned are not to be 
modified or obscured in any way. All other mechanisms or 
sections are covered under AGPL.
No derivative works are allowed to modify:
 - This file
 - EULA
 - AGPL_LICENSE
 - Mechanisms presenting the EULA to potential end users
 
Note: The AGPL is copyrighted, so modifications to AGPL are
      not allowed.
